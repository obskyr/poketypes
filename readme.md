##What is Pokétypes?

Pokétypes is a small web app for comparing and learning the different Pokémon type relations. If you're unsure about if your attack will be effective, just quickly bring up Pokétypes and check. It can be reached and tried at [types.obskyr.io](http://types.obskyr.io/).

###pokehelp.js

`pokehelp.js` is almost a straight port of `pokehelp.py` from an earlier project of mine. It is fairly useful for comparing effectivity between Pokémon types - and no one should ever have to go through typing out the different relations ever again. Feel free to use it at any time, in any project, commercial or otherwise. The main function you'll use is `attackEffectivity()`.

###Oh, and...

If you've somehow stumbled upon this page and have some opinion about Pokétypes, I'd love it if you talked to me about it! I can be reached at [powpowd@gmail.com](mailto:powpowd@gmail.com), or preferably on twitter at [@obskyr](http://twitter.com/obskyr/).
